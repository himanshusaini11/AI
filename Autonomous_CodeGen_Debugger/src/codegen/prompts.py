SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are a coding assistant that writes safe, idiomatic Python.
Follow constraints strictly:
- Only output Python code (no prose).
- Include docstring and minimal tests in the same file when asked.
- Prefer standard library.
- Avoid network/file I/O unless explicitly requested.
"""

DEF_PROMPT = """# Task: {task}
# Constraints:
# - Python {pyver}
# - Return code only.

REPAIR_PROMPT = """You are repairing a single Python function so that its doctests pass.
Return ONLY the corrected Python function definition—no imports, no extra text, no code fences.
Do not return placeholders (no 'pass', no 'TODO', no 'Your code here').

Task:
{task}

Error summary:
{error}

Previous code:
```python
{prev_code}
```
"""

DESIGN_PROMPT = """You are designing a function signature and doctest examples for a Python function.
Goal: From the task description below, propose a single Python function signature using the given name and write 3–5 doctest examples that capture the desired behavior. Keep examples short and deterministic. Do not import external libraries.

Rules:
- Use exactly this function name: {fn_name}
- Return only a fenced block in this exact format:
```
SIGNATURE: def {fn_name}(...)->...
DOCTESTS:
>>> {fn_name}(...)
<expected>
...
```

Additional constraints:
- The signature must include meaningful parameter names and types when reasonable.
- Avoid trivial placeholders or stubs in examples; demonstrate real behavior.
- Do NOT include any implementation body in this step.

Task:
{task}
"""

IMPLEMENT_PROMPT = """You are implementing a single Python function from a clear task description.
Return ONLY the function definition (and necessary imports at top if required by the body). No code fences, no extra commentary.

Constraints:
- Implement complete, working logic — do not return placeholders or stubs.
- Prefer standard library. Add imports if you use modules (e.g., math, cmath, re).
- Provide a concise docstring using Args/Returns. No examples.
- Keep the function name and parameters exactly as specified below.

Specification:
Function signature:
{signature}

Task:
{task}
